## How to Play

Playing Countdown is simple and engaging. The game consists of several rounds of letter selection, allowing you to challenge yourself to form the longest word possible. Here's how to start:

1. **Run the Game**  
   Launch the game by running the Python script:

   ```bash
   python countdown.py
   ```

2. **Choose Your Letters**  
   The game will prompt you to choose a vowel or a consonant one at a time. You'll see your letters displayed on the screen as you make your selections:

   ```
   Choose 'v' for a vowel, 'c' for a consonant: 
   ```

3. **Think Fast**  
   Once all nine letters are chosen, you have 30 seconds to think of the longest word possible. Type your word and press Enter before time runs out!

4. **See Your Score**  
   After the time is up, the game will validate your word and reveal the longest possible word from the selected letters. Challenge yourself to see if you can match or beat the game!
